This is basically my first project I consider big one. 
The goal here is to create something functional, out of things I've tried elsewhere and from things I recently discovered and wanted to see how they practically work. 
Its just something I created because I was curious about one thing, then I thought about how this thing I created could link to something else, and then I got curious about the next thing and that led to another and so on, and now its to the point where its "fully" functional. 
This took a little more than a month to finish, since Ive been coding some smaller projects on the side to widen my JavaScript knowledge.
By no means is this perfect project.
